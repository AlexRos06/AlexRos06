### <div align="center">Alexander Rosushchan
**Data Scientist & Analyst **

A results-driven Data Scientist and Analyst with a unique background spanning the high-stakes worlds of e-commerce, finance, and logistics. I specialize in transforming raw, complex data into clear, actionable intelligence, driving strategic decision-making at the intersection of IT and core business operations.

My expertise was forged in the corporate hubs of Ozon (E-commerce) and Sogaz (Finance/Insurance), where I navigated data streams to optimize operations and illuminate new pathways for growth. I operate on the principle that in a world drowning in data, the right insight is a sharper weapon than any blade.

I hold a Bachelor's in World Economics and Politics and am currently advancing my expertise through a Master's in Data Science at the prestigious Higher School of Economics, Faculty of Computer Science. My approach is a synthesis of deep economic understanding and cutting-edge computational techniquesâ€”because to see the future, you need to understand both the code and the capital.</div>  
  



### Road to Kaggle Grandmaster  
- ðŸ”­ Kaggle Fan  
My ongoing initiative to conquer the competitive machine learning landscape of [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/alexanderrrros).

This is my training ground, my personal Tyrell Corporation building better models. Here, I tackle diverse datasets and problems, constantly sharpening my algorithms in the relentless rain of real-world data. It's not just about the score; it's about evolving. More human than human in model precision.  
  



### University projects  
- ðŸŽ“ University Projects | HSE Faculty of Computer Science (2024-2026)
A curated collection of academic work from my Master's program.

This repository serves as a digital archive of my academic journey. It contains projects and research that form the foundational code of my expertiseâ€”from advanced statistical modeling and neural networks to data engineering pipelines. Consider it the source code to my own professional development, a blend of rigorous theory and applied science.
